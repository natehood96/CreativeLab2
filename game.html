      <p>
        You're a Pokemon on a mission: getting to Pallet Town. You've got a fast car,
        but the road is unpredictable and filled with trainers who are out to get you. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Use the left and right arrow keys to drive side to side.
        Make sure you stay on the path and avoid the trainers trying to stop you!
      </p>
      <p>
        As you level up along the way, the game will become more difficult. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you reach Pallet Town, keep playing to see how long you can survive.
      </p>
      <p>
        Press "p" at any time to pause the game, and "r" to resume.
